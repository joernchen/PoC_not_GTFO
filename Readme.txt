This is just a crude PoC!

dakami_rng.ff100k <- 100k "random" bytes generated by dakami_rng.html
                     in a Firefox 24.0 running on Linux
Output.txt <- dakami_rng.rb used on dakami_rng.ff100k

Observe that the number of occurrences of a given "random" byte 
somehow correlates to the Hamming weight of that byte.

For further background on this see [0].

Cheers to Dan!
